Extracting spatiotemporal features from CSI and sound and obtaining potential candidates

# audio processing

1. If the collected sound is too low, the command to increase the volume by 20 times can be used：

   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i temp.wav -filter:a "volume=20.0" temp_loud.wav
   ```

2. Run `声音降噪.py` ：

   Select a silent section at the end of the sound as background noise to denoise the entire sound。

3. Run `声音处理.py` ：

   Calculate short-term energy using sliding window method, and then use K-means clustering to find the point of keystroke sound occurrence。

## CSI processing

1. Run `预处理.py`

   Firstly, read the 'CSI' data, fill the empty data portion with the average of its subcarriers, then extract the first 10 seconds of data for spline interpolation as input data, use a Butterworth low-pass filter to reduce noise disturbance, and finally choose to use the 'PCA' to extract principal components or use the 'MRC' algorithm for maximum signal-to-noise ratio.

2. Run `分割击键.py`

   Firstly, align the absolute time points of the 'CSI' data and sound data, use the sliding window method to calculate the energy or dispersion of the 'CSI', define the portion above the threshold as the waveform generated by keystrokes, and obtain the keystroke waveform and keystroke interval time.

3. Run `时空特征提取.py`

   Use the DTW algorithm to calculate the distance matrix of the keystroke waveform, where if two waveforms overlap, they are marked as adhesive waveforms. Then calculate the distance matrix of the keystroke interval time, and obtain the spatial and temporal features of the target sequence based on the threshold. The temporal features are sorted in ascending order of the average interval time, numbered 12345. Adjust the temporal features based on the adhesion of the spatial features to ensure that the time feature between adhesive keys is 1.

4. Run `候选者猜测.py`

  `Match possible sequences with and without adhesive conditions. `When there is no adhesive situation, match the spatiotemporal feature list normally to find possible sequences. `When there is a bonding situation, the bonding situation needs to be considered when matching spatial features. First, the temporal features are matched to find possible numerical sequences. Then, the bonding part and non bonding part are separated, and the spatial features of the non bonding part are calculated one by one to determine if they match. At the same time, if the numerical difference between the bonding part and the non bonding part is less than or equal to 1, both will be added to the candidate list.

## else

1. Production of spatiotemporal feature list：

   Adjust the distance between the keys you need and the length of the target sequence, and run 'table_maker. py' to generate the form.
